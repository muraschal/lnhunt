# ‚ö° lnhunt

**An Interactive Bitcoin Lightning Experience for Education, Events, and Communities**

---

## ‚ú® Overview

**lnhunt** is a gamified learning app built on the Vercel Fullstack (Next.js + Serverless). It enables users to explore Bitcoin and Lightning through a location-based or digital scavenger hunt. Each quiz station is unlocked via a Lightning payment using LNURL-Pay.

Correct answers reveal keywords. When combined, these form a predefined sentence or phrase ‚Äì often drawn from Bitcoin history, but fully customizable.

---

## üéØ Learning Goals

- Real-world interaction with the Lightning Network (QR codes, LNURL, fees, wallets)
- Reinforcement of key concepts (e.g. time preference, money history, protocol design)
- Physical activation and team collaboration
- Gamified knowledge transfer with emotional anchoring
- **Encourages exploration and real-world interaction by requiring players to find physical codes at physical locations.**

---

## üß† Game Mechanics

- Multiple quiz stations, each with a unique question
- Two-step access process:
  1. Enter the correct physical code (found in the real world)
  2. Complete the Lightning payment to unlock the question
- **Physical codes (code_physical) are distributed in the physical world (e.g. as QR codes, stickers, or clues at specific locations). Players must find them to unlock each question.**
- **After answering correctly, you receive a digital code (code_digital) as a solution word for the final phrase.**
- Configurable access modes:
  - *Low-fee*: Multiple Choice with feedback
  - *Premium*: Instant access to the correct answer
- Correct answers unlock one word (or element) each
- **Solved questions display a full-tile image badge and a checkmark.**
- **Progress indicator and secret phrase are only shown if at least one question is solved.**
- Goal: Collect all elements and reconstruct a final message

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Simplified)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as App
    participant L as LNbits
    participant W as Wallet

    U->>A: Opens station (e.g. /q1)
    A->>U: Prompts for physical code
    U->>A: Enters physical code
    A->>U: Displays LNURL-Pay QR code (from config)
    U->>W: Pays Lightning invoice via wallet
    W->>L: Sends payment to LNbits
    A-->>L: Polls LNbits if payment was received
    L-->>A: Confirms payment
    A->>U: Reveals the quiz question
```

Each question is locked behind both a physical code and a Lightning payment. Once both are completed, the question is revealed. Answering it correctly unlocks a "digital code" for the final message.
**Solved questions display their image as a badge on the start screen.**

---

## üß© Sample Knowledge Areas

- Bitcoin fundamentals and economic history  
- Cantillon Effect  
- Time Preference  
- Protocol concepts (e.g. Static Channel Backups, Submarine Swaps)  
- Key historic events and personalities (e.g. 1971 Nixon shock, Silk Road)

All questions and answers are fully customizable via JSON.
**Each question can have an image ("image": "q1.png") that is shown in the question screen and as a badge.**
**Hints are only shown in the question screen (with toggle button), not on the start page.**

- Blends movement, collaboration, and learning  
- Modern, accessible UI with smooth animations
- Two-factor access (knowledge + payment) for enhanced engagement
- **All static assets (images, audio) are versioned in the public folder.**
- **Copyright notice in the footer with the current year.**
- **Responsive, accessible UI.**

## üîß LNbits Setup (Basic)

To keep things simple, use [LNbits](https://legend.lnbits.com) as your Lightning backend:

1. **Create a Wallet** on LNbits (no node required)
2. Enable the **LNURLp plugin** under Extensions
3. For each question (`/q1`, `/q2`, etc.):
   - Create one LNURL-Pay link via the plugin
   - Use a fixed amount (e.g. 100 sats)
   - Set `description` to the question ID (e.g. `"q1"`)
4. Copy the **LNURL** and insert it into your `questions.json` config:

```json
{
  "id": "q1",
  "question": "What is the block subsidy after the next halving?",
  "options": [
    "1.25 BTC",
    "1.5625 BTC",
    "1.75 BTC"
  ],
  "correct_index": 1,
  "code_digital": "fix",
  "code_physical": "magic",
  "hint": "The block subsidy halves every 210,000 blocks.",
  "image": "q1.png"
}
```

5. The frontend displays this LNURL as a QR code.
6. The backend polls LNbits to check if the payment has been received.
7. Once confirmed, the question becomes visible to the user.
**After all questions are solved, a prominent button 'Finish LNHunt & Sats geschenkt bekommen!' appears at the top.**
**The final LNURL is shown as a QR code and direct link. The participant's name should be entered in the comment field of the wallet. After successful withdrawal, the success URL redirects to `/thnx`.**

No dynamic invoice creation. No node. No complexity. Just working.

## üõ†Ô∏è F√ºr Entwickler

### Systemanforderungen
- Node.js 16.x oder h√∂her
- NPM 7.x oder h√∂her
- Moderne Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Entwicklungsmodus
Die Anwendung besitzt einen eingebauten Entwicklungsmodus, der aktiviert wird, wenn keine LNbits-API-Schl√ºssel konfiguriert sind. In diesem Modus werden Lightning-Zahlungen simuliert, sodass keine echten Sats verwendet werden m√ºssen.

### Sicherheitshinweise
- Speichern Sie niemals sensitive Daten wie API-Schl√ºssel im Git-Repository
- Die `.env.local` Datei ist in `.gitignore` eingetragen und sollte NIEMALS eingecheckt werden
- Die Anwendung implementiert Rate-Limiting f√ºr API-Anfragen zur Verhinderung von Missbrauch

### Fehlerbehandlung
H√§ufige Probleme:
- **API-Fehler**: √úberpr√ºfen Sie die API-Schl√ºssel und URL in Ihren Umgebungsvariablen
- **Zahlungsfehler**: Stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihre LNbits-Instanz korrekt konfiguriert ist
- **Entwicklungsmodus**: F√ºr Tests ohne echte Zahlungen k√∂nnen Sie die API-Schl√ºssel leer lassen
